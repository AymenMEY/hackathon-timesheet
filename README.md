Welcome to T&I's Hackathon! We're thrilled to have you with us. This hackathon is an opportunity for you to showcase your skills and creativity by building the worst timesheet experience within a limited time frame.

This repository contains all resources and guidelines for participating in the hackathon. Here you'll find everything you need to get started, including setup instructions, rules, and useful links to aid you in your coding journey.

# Get Started <a name="getstarted"></a>
First off, with your team, decide the basis of your website:
- *Do you want to use your prefered programming languages and technologies?* You can write the code from scrath with no limitations!
- *Do you prefer to start with a functioning and familiar timesheet website, shown by the image below?* You can use the source code of this repository that is based on Angular (a NodeJS library).

Then, choose either one of the following workspaces for your team:
- [Local PC Configuration](#pc) if you wish to code on your local PC, or
- [VM Configuration](#vm) if you wish to be spared from the burden of EY-restricted PCs.

## Local-PC Configuration <a name="pc"></a>
So, you wish to code on your EY-restricted local PC? Very brave of you... You will need the following: 
- **Code Editor**: Make sure you have a proper code editor. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
- If you prefer to start from this source code:
  1. **Source Code**: Download this [ZIP-compressed source code](https://github.com/AymenMEY/hackathon-timesheet/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it locally.
  2. **NodeJS**: Download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and install it.
  3. **Compile & Execute**:
     1. Open the extracted folder with your code editor.
     2. Compile and install all dependencies: ```npm install```
     3. Execute the code: ```npm start```
     4. You can now access the website via this address: http://localhost:4200/


## VM Configuration <a name="vm"></a>
So, you chose the easy way out... Smart of you. There are preconfigured machines that you can easily access. Just ask one of the organizers to give you access. You will be all set!

# Rules <a name="rules"></a>
>*"A timesheet is a method for recording the amount of a worker's time spent on each job." ~ Wikipedia.*
- **Goal:** Build a functioning website with the worst timesheet experience.
- **Free as a bird:** You can build your website either from the source code of this repo or start from scrath!
- **The Only Requirement**: We let you interpret the definition cited above ... **but**, by the end, your timesheet must contain at least these details:
  - An Engagement Code
  - A Location
  - Daily Work Hours  
- **Code of Conduct**: Respect fellow participants and adhere to the hackathon's code of conduct. Discriminatory or offensive behavior will be not tolerated.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Code Of Conduct** may be neglicted upon agreement with one of the organizers.


# Evaluation <a name="evaluation"></a>
Just like Eurovision, websites will be judged by every participant based on creativity and technical complexity:
1. Each team picks a participant who will test their website. 
3. Each participant must assign 0, 1, 3, and 5 points to each team. Beware a point can only be given once. 
4. If you feel generous enough, you can even give a +1 for the teams who touched your heart or whose code seems extra innovative. 
5. Winners get the reward of their lives!
